Version 1.1.1
=============
Changes to previous version

* Fixed bug in envcpt function that meant that if a non-changepoint model was not specified in the list of models to fit, and no changepoints were detected in the changepoint model then the log-likelihood was recorded in the output as NA instead of the value fitted.

Version 1.1
===========
Changes to previous version

* Added option to envcpt to choose a subset of models to run.
* The subset selection also follows through to plotting whereby only the models fitted are plotted.
* BIC method added.
* AICweights function added to calculate the AIC weights for the models fitted.
* Removed dependency on forecast package in favour of directly using arima function from stats package. (slimming reverse dependencies)
* Added new tests for the new functionality
* Added EnvCpt paper to references

Version 1.0
=============
Changes to previous version

* Coding for cpt.reg has been implemented in C.
* Changepoints in normal linear regression takes advantage of the Fortran dqrls command that is called with lm.fit. As such, potential multicollinearity is appropriately managed.
* cpt.reg is available for any number of regressors.
* The file LMregression.R is no longer used and so is removed.

Version 0.1.1
=============
Changes to previous version

* Did corrections for CRAN submission.
* Corrected plot(.,type='aic') to do the correct axis drawing when yaxt is specified.
* Added man page for the package.
